    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Horrid  is a popular children's book series written by Francesca Simon. 
        The mischievous and naughty protagonist, Henry, is a lovable but troublesome six-year-old who delights in playing 
        pranks on his family and friends. With his quick wit and cunning nature, Henry often gets into trouble, much to the 
        frustration of his parents and brother. Despite his horrid behavior, Henry's antics are relatable and entertaining,
         making him a beloved character among children and parents alike. The series has been praised for its humor, wit, and
          ability to tackle complex emotions and social issues in a way that is accessible to young readers.</p>
